= Contributing Guide

== Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Sign off commits (`git commit -s`)
4. Submit a pull request

== Commit Guidelines

* Conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
* Sign all commits (DCO required)
* Atomic, focused commits

== Language Policy

* ReScript only for frontend/JS-adjacent work.
* TypeScript/JavaScript are not permitted.
* CI enforces the policy and will fail PRs that add TS/JS files.
