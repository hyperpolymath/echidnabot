== Vision

Echidnabot aims to be the **definitive formal verification CI bot**, orchestrating ECHIDNA to verify mathematical proofs automatically on every push across all major git forges.

== Near-Term Goals (v0.2.0 - Q1 2026)

=== 1. Complete Tier 1 Prover Support

**Priority: HIGH**

* [ ] Finish Coq integration (100% coverage of standard library tactics)
* [ ] Complete Lean 4 support (Mathlib integration)
* [ ] Improve Agda performance (parallel type-checking)
* [ ] Isabelle/HOL sledgehammer integration
* [ ] Z3 and CVC5 optimization (timeout tuning)

**Why:** Ensure rock-solid support for most popular provers.

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

=== 2. ML-Powered Tactic Suggestions

**Priority: MEDIUM**

* [ ] Integrate Julia ML backend fully
* [ ] Train models on successful proof patterns
* [ ] Context-aware tactic suggestion
* [ ] Proof repair hints (suggest fixes for failing proofs)

**Why:** Help developers fix failing proofs faster.

**Effort:** 4-5 weeks (research + implementation)

=== 3. Proof Caching & Incremental Verification

**Priority: HIGH**

* [ ] Cache verified proofs (skip re-verification)
* [ ] Incremental verification (only changed theorems)
* [ ] Proof dependency tracking
* [ ] Smart invalidation (detect affected proofs)

**Why:** Dramatically speed up CI for large proof repos.

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks

== Mid-Term Goals (v0.3.0 - Q2 2026)

=== 1. Consultant Mode

**Priority: MEDIUM**

* [ ] Natural language proof queries ("Why did this proof fail?")
* [ ] Proof state inspection via GraphQL
* [ ] Interactive proof debugging
* [ ] Step-by-step proof explanation

**Why:** Make formal verification more accessible.

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

=== 2. Regulator Mode

**Priority: HIGH**

* [ ] Block PR merges on proof failures
* [ ] Configurable severity levels (error, warning)
* [ ] Exemption system (skip specific theorems)
* [ ] Required proof coverage per PR

**Why:** Enforce proof requirements at the gate.

**Effort:** 2 weeks

=== 3. Tier 2 & 3 Prover Completion

**Priority: MEDIUM**

* [ ] Complete Metamath, HOL Light, Mizar (Tier 2 → 100%)
* [ ] Add PVS, ACL2, HOL4 (Tier 3 → 80%)
* [ ] Unified prover interface
* [ ] Auto-detect prover from file extensions

**Why:** Support more proof ecosystems.

**Effort:** 4-6 weeks

=== 4. Integration with Other Bots

**Priority: HIGH**

* [ ] Coordinate with rhodibot (RSR compliance first)
* [ ] Share context with finishingbot (proofs verified before release)
* [ ] Hypatia orchestration support
* [ ] Fleet-wide proof dashboard

**Why:** Enable multi-bot workflows.

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

== Long-Term Vision (v1.0.0 - Q3-Q4 2026)

=== 1. Proof Synthesis

**Priority: RESEARCH (Ambitious)

* [ ] AI-powered proof sketch generation
* [ ] Theorem statement from informal description
* [ ] Proof completion (fill in sorry/admit holes)
* [ ] Cross-prover proof translation

**Why:** Make formal verification accessible to non-experts.

**Effort:** 8-12 weeks (research + implementation)

=== 2. Distributed Proof Verification

**Priority: MEDIUM**

* [ ] Parallel proof checking across workers
* [ ] Cloud-native verification (Kubernetes)
* [ ] Spot instance support (cost optimization)
* [ ] Proof queue management

**Why:** Scale to massive proof repositories.

**Effort:** 4-5 weeks

=== 3. Proof Library Integration

**Priority: MEDIUM**

* [ ] Mathlib (Lean) integration
* [ ] Coq stdlib + ext-lib
* [ ] Agda stdlib
* [ ] Isabelle/AFP (Archive of Formal Proofs)
* [ ] Auto-import missing dependencies

**Why:** Seamless use of standard libraries.

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

=== 4. Educational Features

**Priority: LOW**

* [ ] Interactive proof tutorials
* [ ] "Fix alongside me" mode
* [ ] Proof pattern learning resources
* [ ] Certification system (verified by echidnabot)

**Why:** Lower barrier to entry for formal methods.

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

== Technical Debt

=== High Priority

* [ ] Refactor platform adapters to shared crate (with rhodibot, seambot)
* [ ] Improve error messages (prover-specific guidance)
* [ ] Add integration tests for all provers
* [ ] Docker image optimization (reduce size, faster builds)

=== Medium Priority

* [ ] Performance optimization (concurrent proof checking)
* [ ] Memory optimization (large proof files)
* [ ] Better logging (structured, prover-specific)
* [ ] Metrics export (Prometheus format)

=== Low Priority

* [ ] WASM compilation (run in browser - limited utility)
* [ ] Plugin system for custom provers
* [ ] Alternative output formats (HTML, PDF)
* [ ] Multi-language support (i18n)

== Community Contributions Welcome

We welcome contributions in these areas:

* **New prover support** (F*, Dafny, TLA+, etc.)
* **Tactic libraries** (common proof patterns)
* **Platform adapters** (Gitea, Codeberg, SourceHut)
* **ML models** (proof synthesis, tactic suggestion)
* **Documentation** (tutorials, examples, case studies)

See link:CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING.md] for guidelines.

== Non-Goals

Echidnabot will NOT:

* Replace human proof engineers (assists, not replaces)
* Verify proofs without ECHIDNA (delegates to ECHIDNA core)
* Support non-theorem-prover languages (Python tests ≠ proofs)
* Guarantee soundness (relies on prover soundness)

== Versioning

Echidnabot follows semantic versioning:

* **v0.x.y** - Pre-1.0, breaking changes allowed between minor versions
* **v1.x.y** - Stable API, breaking changes only in major versions
* **vX.0.0** - Major release with new features and possible breaking changes

== Release Cadence

* **Patch releases** (v0.1.x) - Weekly or as needed for bug fixes
* **Minor releases** (v0.x.0) - Monthly with new features
* **Major releases** (v1.0.0+) - When stable API is ready (Q4 2026 target)
